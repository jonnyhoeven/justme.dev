    on top of management based on the following github readme: TPA is an orchestration tool that uses Ansible to deploy Postgres
    clusters according to EDB''s recommendations. TPA embodies the best practices followed by EDB, informed by many years
    of hard-earned experience with deploying and  supporting Postgres. These recommendations apply to quick testbed setups
    as well as production environments. TPA is built around a declarative configuration mechanism that you can use to describe
    a Postgres cluster, from its topology to the smallest details of its configuration. Start by running tpaexec configure
    to generate an initial cluster configuration based on a few high-level choices, such as the Postgres version to install.
    The default configuration is ready to use as is, but you can edit it to suit your needs. (The generated configuration
    is a text file, config.yml). Using this configuration, TPA can: Provision servers, for example, AWS EC2 instances or Docker
    containers, and any other resources needed to host the cluster. Or you can deploy to existing servers or VMs just by specifying
    connection details. Configure the operating system, for example, tweak kernel settings, create users and SSH keys, install
    packages, define systemd services, set up log rotation, and so on. Install and configure Postgres and associated components,
    such as PGD, Barman, pgbouncer, repmgr, and various Postgres extensions. Run automated tests on the cluster after deployment.
    Deploy future changes to your configuration, such as changing Postgres settings, installing and upgrading packages, adding
    new servers, and so on.'

**  TPA offers a declarative configuration mechanism to describe a Postgres cluster, encompassing its topology,
configuration details, and resources. To get started, run `tpaexec configure` to generate an initial configuration based
on high-level choices. The generated configuration file, `config.yml`, can be edited to suit your needs. With this
configuration, TPA can provision servers, configure operating systems, install and configure Postgres components, and
run automated tests. It also enables deploying future changes to the cluster with ease.
