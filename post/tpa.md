intro: TPA is a powerful tool for structuring Postgres projects and staying on top of management. As a developer, you know
  how important it is to have a solid foundation for your projects, and TPA provides just that. With its declarative configuration
  mechanism and built-in automation features, TPA makes it easy to deploy and manage Postgres clusters with ease. In this
  blog post, we'll take a closer look at what TPA is and how it can help you streamline your development process.

    on top of management based on the following github readme: TPA is an orchestration tool that uses Ansible to deploy Postgres
    clusters according to EDB''s recommendations. TPA embodies the best practices followed by EDB, informed by many years
    of hard-earned experience with deploying and  supporting Postgres. These recommendations apply to quick testbed setups
    as well as production environments. TPA is built around a declarative configuration mechanism that you can use to describe
    a Postgres cluster, from its topology to the smallest details of its configuration. Start by running tpaexec configure
    to generate an initial cluster configuration based on a few high-level choices, such as the Postgres version to install.
    The default configuration is ready to use as is, but you can edit it to suit your needs. (The generated configuration
    is a text file, config.yml). Using this configuration, TPA can: Provision servers, for example, AWS EC2 instances or Docker
    containers, and any other resources needed to host the cluster. Or you can deploy to existing servers or VMs just by specifying
    connection details. Configure the operating system, for example, tweak kernel settings, create users and SSH keys, install
    packages, define systemd services, set up log rotation, and so on. Install and configure Postgres and associated components,
    such as PGD, Barman, pgbouncer, repmgr, and various Postgres extensions. Run automated tests on the cluster after deployment.
    Deploy future changes to your configuration, such as changing Postgres settings, installing and upgrading packages, adding
    new servers, and so on.'

TPA is an open-source tool that uses Ansible to deploy Postgres clusters according to EDB's recommendations. The tool
embodies the best practices followed by EDB, informed by many years of experience with deploying and supporting Postgres.
TPA provides a declarative configuration mechanism that allows you to describe a Postgres cluster in a text file,
config.yml. With TPA, you can easily provision servers, configure the operating system, install and configure Postgres
and associated components, run automated tests on the cluster, and deploy future changes to your configuration.  One of
the standout features of TPA is its ability to automate the deployment and management of Postgres clusters. With TPA, you
can easily deploy Postgres clusters on AWS EC2 instances or Docker containers, or deploy to existing servers or VMs by
specifying connection details. TPA also provides a range of configuration options for tweaking kernel settings, creating
users and SSH keys, installing packages, defining systemd services, setting up log rotation, and more.  Another benefit
of using TPA is its ability to run automated tests on the cluster after deployment. This ensures that your Postgres
cluster is functioning correctly and can detect any issues early on. Additionally, TPA makes it easy to deploy future
changes to your configuration, such as changing Postgres settings, installing and upgrading packages, adding new servers,
and more.  In conclusion, TPA is a powerful tool for structuring Postgres projects and staying on top of management. With
its declarative configuration mechanism and built-in automation features, TPA makes it easy to deploy and manage Postgres
clusters with ease. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, TPA is an invaluable resource for any
Postgres project.
