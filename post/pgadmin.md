pgAdmin4 is a powerful and versatile tool that simplifies the process of managing Postgres databases. It offers a user-
friendly graphical interface that allows users to easily create, maintain, and use database objects. Whether you are new
to Postgres or an experienced user, pgAdmin4 has the features you need to manage your databases effectively.  One of the
key advantages of pgAdmin4 is its flexibility. It can be used as a standalone desktop application or deployed on a web
server for access through web browsers. This makes it an ideal solution for both individual users and organizations with
multiple users.  The development of pgAdmin4 involved a complete rewrite of the previous version, using modern
technologies such as Python and JavaScript/jQuery. This has resulted in a more efficient and responsive application that
is easier to maintain and extend. The use of NWjs, a desktop runtime written in Node.js, allows pgAdmin4 to run
standalone on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.  In addition to its core functionality, pgAdmin4
offers a range of advanced features that cater to the needs of experienced Postgres users. These include support for
advanced query editing, the ability to create and manage database roles and permissions, and integration with popular
version control systems like Git.  The user interface of pgAdmin4 has been designed with usability in mind. It features
a clean and intuitive layout that makes it easy to navigate and access the features you need. The interface also
includes a variety of customization options, allowing users to tailor the application to their preferences and workflow.
For organizations, pgAdmin4 offers a range of deployment options that can be tailored to meet specific requirements. It
can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud, and supports integration with popular web servers like Apache and Nginx.
This flexibility makes it an ideal choice for organizations looking to standardize on a single database management tool
