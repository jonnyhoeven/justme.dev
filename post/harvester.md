intro: Harvester is a modern, open-source, and interoperable infrastructure solution built on Kubernetes, designed to provide
  a cloud-native hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) experience for operators. It offers a unified platform for managing traditional
  virtual machines (VMs) and containerized environments, making it an ideal choice for edge networks. With its ability to
  run on bare metal servers and provide integrated virtualization and distributed storage capabilities, Harvester is an enterprise-ready
  platform that leverages local storage for a more straightforward and efficient infrastructure management experience.

Harvester is a game-changer for edge networks, providing a seamless and efficient way to manage both traditional VMs and
containerized environments. With its easy-to-use interface and automation capabilities, Harvester simplifies
infrastructure management, making it easier for operators to focus on other critical tasks. One of the standout features
of Harvester is its integration with Rancher, allowing operators to manage their VM workloads alongside their Kubernetes
clusters. This integration provides a unified platform for managing all types of workloads, making it easier to optimize
resources and improve overall network performance. Additionally, Harvester's support for distributed block storage and
tiering, as well as its ability to create, edit, clone, and export volumes, makes it an ideal choice for managing storage
in edge networks. Overall, Harvester is a powerful tool for edge networks, providing a modern, open-source, and
interoperable infrastructure solution that can help operators streamline their infrastructure management and improve
overall network performance.
