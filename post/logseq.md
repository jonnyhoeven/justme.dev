    make sure your notes are secure and locked away from prying eyes, a more common goal for many notes apps online. Logseq
    is a hidden gem in the Tools for Thought space. In this article, we explore what is Logseq, its strengths, and how you
    can get started with Logseq. I have had the real pleasure of using Logseq for the last two months as my daily driver for
    taking notes for work and personal life. I do a lot of project management, research, article writing, and preparation
    of presentations. Logseq is a powerful tool for all these tasks and I believe has not received the favorable attention
    it deserves. It is a tool I will recommend and continue to use. In this review of Logseq, I want to draw your attention
    to the details of this wonderful tool. First, I will provide a brief description of Logseq, then who I think Logseq is
    for, followed by the features that stood out to me in my daily use, and finally, how you can get started using Logseq.'
