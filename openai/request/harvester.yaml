      Write a blog post about harvester and what it does, how it can be used for edge networks.
      based on the following github readme: Harvester is a modern, open, interoperable, hyperconverged infrastructure 
      (HCI) solution built on Kubernetes. It is an open-source alternative designed for operators seeking a cloud-native 
      HCI solution. Harvester runs on bare metal servers and provides integrated virtualization and distributed storage 
      capabilities. In addition to traditional virtual machines (VMs), Harvester supports containerized environments 
      automatically through integration with Rancher.
