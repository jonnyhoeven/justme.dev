      Write a blog post about TPA trusted Postgres Architect and what it means for structuring projects and staying on top of management
      based on the following github readme: TPA is an orchestration tool that uses Ansible to deploy Postgres clusters according to EDB's recommendations.
      TPA embodies the best practices followed by EDB, informed by many years of hard-earned experience with deploying and 
      supporting Postgres. These recommendations apply to quick testbed setups as well as production environments.
      TPA is built around a declarative configuration mechanism that you can use to describe a Postgres cluster, from its topology to the smallest details of its configuration.
      Start by running tpaexec configure to generate an initial cluster configuration based on a few high-level choices, such as the Postgres version to install. The default configuration is ready to use as is, but you can edit it to suit your needs. (The generated configuration is a text file, config.yml).
      Using this configuration, TPA can:
      Provision servers, for example, AWS EC2 instances or Docker containers, and any other resources needed to host the cluster. Or you can deploy to existing servers or VMs just by specifying connection details.
      Configure the operating system, for example, tweak kernel settings, create users and SSH keys, install packages, define systemd services, set up log rotation, and so on.
      Install and configure Postgres and associated components, such as PGD, Barman, pgbouncer, repmgr, and various Postgres extensions.
      Run automated tests on the cluster after deployment.
      Deploy future changes to your configuration, such as changing Postgres settings, installing and upgrading packages, adding new servers, and so on.
