      Write a blog post about logseq and what it means for structuring projects and staying on top of management
      based on the following github readme: Logseq is a privacy focused note-taking application that is open-source and 
      wants to make sure your notes are secure and locked away from prying eyes, a more common goal for many notes apps online.
      Logseq is a hidden gem in the Tools for Thought space. In this article, we explore what is Logseq, its strengths, and how you can get started with Logseq.
      I have had the real pleasure of using Logseq for the last two months as my daily driver for taking notes for work and personal life. I do a lot of project management, research, article writing, and preparation of presentations. Logseq is a powerful tool for all these tasks and I believe has not received the favorable attention it deserves.
      It is a tool I will recommend and continue to use.
      In this review of Logseq, I want to draw your attention to the details of this wonderful tool. First, I will provide a brief description of Logseq, then who I think Logseq is for, followed by the features that stood out to me in my daily use, and finally, how you can get started using Logseq.
