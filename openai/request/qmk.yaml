      Write a blog post about QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard)
      based on the following github readme: QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) is an open source community centered 
      around developing computer input devices. The community encompasses all sorts of input devices, 
      such as keyboards, mice, and MIDI devices. A core group of collaborators maintains QMK Firmware, 
      QMK Configurator, QMK Toolbox, qmk.fm, and this documentation with the help of community members like you.
      QMK has lots of features to explore, and a good deal of reference documentation to dig through. 
      Most features are taken advantage of by modifying your keymap, and changing the keycodes.
